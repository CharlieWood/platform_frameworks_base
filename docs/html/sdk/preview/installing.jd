page.title=Getting Started with Honeycomb
@jd:body

<p>First, you need to set up your development environment with the new SDK Tools and preview
platform:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Unpack the SDK Tools r8 package you've received.
    <p>If you have an existing Android SDK directory, simply replace your existing {@code
tools/} directory with the one from the new package and add the {@code platform-tools/}
directory along side it (at the root of the SDK directory).</p></li>
  <li>Unpack the platform package ({@code android-Froyo}) and place it in your SDK's {@code
platforms/} directory.</li>
  <li>If you're using Eclipse, also update your Eclipse plugin using the provided archive file.
    <ol>
      <li>Select <strong>Help > Install new software</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Archive</strong>.</li>
      <li>Locate and select the archive file. Click <strong>OK</strong>.
        <p>Developer Tools now appear in the Available Software window and you can proceed
to install the plugin.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Beginning with SDK Tools r8 (the version you've received),
the {@code adb} tool is now located in the {@code &lt;sdk&gt;/platform-tools/} directory (instead
of in {@code &lt;sdk&gt;/tools/}). Be sure to update your {@code PATH} environment variable and any
build/debugging scripts you have.</p>



<h2 id="Setup">Set Up Your AVD and Application</h2>

<p>With your SDK now set up, follow these steps to start developing an application for
Honeycomb.</p>

<ol>

  <li>Create a new AVD targeted to "Android Froyo (Preview)" and with a custom skin resolution of
1280 x 800.</li>

  <li>Set the build target of your application to "Android Froyo (Preview)".</li>
  <li>Set your manifest file's {@code &lt;uses-sdk&gt;} element to use {@code
android:minSdkVersion="Froyo"}. For example:
<pre>
&lt;manifest&gt;
    &lt;uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="Froyo" /&gt;
    ...
&lt;/manifest&gt;
</pre>
<p>"Froyo" is a provisional API Level for the Honeycomb release, used only during the preview
period. When the APIs are
finalized and the SDK is released publicly, you must update this with the appropriate API Level
integer.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> By providing your {@code &lt;uses-sdk&gt;} element in the
manifest file <em>before</em> the {@code &lt;application&gt;} element, your application will
automatically apply the new Holographic theme.</p>
</li>

</ol>
